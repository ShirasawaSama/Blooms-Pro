# Starter Photoshop Plugin (Vanilla)

This starter plugin is a good place to get started when developing for Photoshop. It does not rely on any frameworks or build steps -- hence the name "Vanilla".

## Load into Photoshop

Make sure Photoshop is up and running first. First, add the plugin to the "Developer Workspace" in the UXP Developer Tools (UDT) application.
  * If you selected "Create Plugin..." earlier, it will have already be there with the plugin ID and name you specified. 
  * Otherwise, click "Add Plugin" and select the `manifest.json` file in the corresponding plugin folder.

Click the ••• button next to the corresponding workspace entry, and click "Load". Switch over to Photoshop, and the plugin's panel will be running. 

## Continue creating
